# LearnerExp
A visualization tool for exploring the time management of online learning activities. This demo is associated with our demo paper in the Web Conference 2019 (WWW 2019). You can access the live demo with sample data here:

This GitHub project is the front-end part extracted from the learning management system (LMS) from our school. For demonstration purpose, we prepared some sample data from the real dataset. The student identification information are removed from the sample data. Since the backend part of LearnerExp system is closely related to our LMS, we cannot open its source code separately. As a result, some functions in this demo is not available, such as loading other datasets, saving custom groups, exporting statistics, etc.
